Stuff that was done during the Piscine (from C00-C08).

Here's some tips if you want to get through the Piscine:

- When submitting, main must NOT be included!
- Finish every project as much as you can (at least up to 50%), don't worry about completing 100% of every project!
- Gather resources via github repos, so you can understand the logic better.
- Maximize the usage of your resources as well as your peers!
- Always always always, make sure your correct norminette errors as you going along (it will save you a lot of time later!)
